# The folder Simulation1/BrestCancerData/FP contains files for fitting fractional polynomial models to the breast cancer data

# 1. First the IPD data needs to be aggregated - the file cr_aggregate_data does this calling the file Function_anova_data and produces the file breast_aggregate_data_fp.csv
# 2. First order fractional polynomial models are fitted in Fit_FP1.R. This files calls the function Function_FP1.R.
# 3. Second order fractional polynomial models are fitted in Fit_FP2.R. This files calls the function Function_FP2.R.
