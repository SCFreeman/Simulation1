Fit_PE_FE_one - fits the piecewise exponential model with one cut point. Note you will need to specify on line 71 which cut point you wish to include within your model.

Fit_PE_FE_two - fits the piecewise exponential model with two cut points. Note you will need to specify on line 74 which cut points you wish to include within your model.

Fit_RP_FE_lnt_1knot - fits the Royston-Parmar model with 1 knot. 

Fit_RP_FE_lnt_2knots - fits the Royston-Parmar model with 2 knots. 

Fit_RP_FE_lnt_3knots - fits the Royston-Parmar model with 3 knots. 

Fit_RP_FE_lnt_4knots - fits the Royston-Parmar model with 4 knots. 

Fit_FP_1stOrder - fits the first order fractional polynomial models.

Fit_FP_2ndOrder - fits second order fractional polynomial models.

# Important - Scenarios 5-8
1. When running the R files "Fit_RP_FE_1knot", "Fit_RP_FE_2knots", "Fit_RP_FE_3knots" and "Fit_RP_FE_4knots" you will need to change the number of studies in each meta-analysis (line 30) and the number of patients in each study (line 33) to reflect that there are 10 studies in each meta-analysis.
2. When running the R files "Fit_PE_FE_one" and "Fit_PE_FE_two" you will need to change the number of studies in each meta-analysis (line 28) to reflect that there are 10 studies in each meta-analysis.
