# The folder 'Simulation1/Results' contains files for processing the results of simulation study.

# cr_results.R creates datasets of estimand data for all models except the second order fractional polynomial models.
# cr_results_FP2.R creates datasets of estimand data for the second order frational polynomial models.

# an_results.R takes the datasets created above and produces the tables and plots included in the paper.
